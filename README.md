# odin-recipes
The current project is odin-recipes.
I have demonstates these skills:
Created index.html file with the list of recipes(lasagnia, pizza, focaccia).

I created lasagnia.html, pizza.html and focaccia.html with the content. On each page I inseted corresponding image of the recipe, the list of nesessary ingrediens and the steps to follow in order to prepare the dish.

I published the website on gitHub.
